# Web Design Challenge | Newsletter signup form


Development of a newsletter signup form, with Mailchimp incorporation.

HTML, CSS and vanilla JavaScript.
(going with basics here so that if needed it would be easily adapted as a component for modern frameworks).

Developed and designed with love ðŸ’™
